what happens:

1. Guide and Curator register to DF
2. Profiler subscribes for Guides to DF and thus gets notifications of new ones
3. after waiting 5 seconds, profiler asks Guide for tour
4. upon receiving tour request, Guide asks Curator for art
5. upon receiving art request, Curator sends replies with art
6. upon receiving art, Guide sends it to Profiler
7. upon receiving art, Profiler starts to ask Curator about it every second


Behaviour usage:
Profiler - WakerBehaviour, TickerBehaviour
Guide - MsgReceiver
Curator - ParallelBehaviour, OneShotBehaviour, CyclicBehaviour


TODO: 
- add SequentialBehaviour
- create some simple data structure for art (eg. list of objects with age,name,data)
- create some simple data structure for profile (eg. minAge, maxAge)
- use profile to choose art
- get user input about services? task #2, in the middle
